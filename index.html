<h1 class="title">EOSC UBC Earth Data Science</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Tenure track assistant professor</p>
</header>
<p>The Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS) at the University of British Columbia invites applicants for a full-time, tenure-track Assistant Professor position in the area of <strong><em>Earth Data Science</em></strong>. We seek applicants whose research addresses <strong><em>fundamental or applied questions in one or more of the Earth, ocean, or atmospheric sciences, using novel data-driven computational techniques</em></strong> such as machine learning and inversion methods to advance knowledge of the Earth system and/or solve geoscience problems of societal relevance. The ideal candidate is methods-oriented, has a track record of collaborative, cross-disciplinary work, and holds a PhD or equivalent in a relevant field.</p>
<p>The successful candidate will be expected to develop a strong, externally funded and internationally-recognized research program, effectively manage and mentor a diverse research group, teach undergraduate and graduate courses, and participate in departmental activities. In addition, the successful candidate will be expected to play an important role in EOAS and Faculty of Science efforts to incorporate data science computation throughout the undergraduate curriculum.</p>
<p>EOAS is the top-ranked and largest Earth Sciences department in Canada, with research and teaching interests that span Earth and planetary systems, including modern and paleo environments from the core to the stratosphere (<a href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/research/areas">www.eoas.ubc.ca</a>). There is also strong potential for collaboration with other groups at UBC, including the Department of Computer Science (<a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/">cs.ubc.ca</a>) and the Data Science Institute (<a href="https://dsi.ubc.ca/">dsi.ubc.ca</a>). EOAS is dedicated to practicing excellence in teaching, and candidates should demonstrate potential for teaching excellence and interest in innovative teaching methods.</p>
<p>Applications should include: i) a cover letter, ii) a detailed curriculum vita, iii) a one-page summary of research interests and accomplishments, iv) a one-page outline of a potential five-year research program, v) a one-page statement of teaching philosophy, vi) three recent publications, and vii) a statement describing your experience working with a diverse student body, as well as your past, present, and/or future contributions to creating/advancing a culture of equity and inclusion on campus. Application materials should be combined into a single PDF document and be uploaded through the UBC Careers website at: <a href="http://www.facultycareers.ubc.ca/XXXX">www.facultycareers.ubc.ca/35189</a> (search keywords: “earth data science”). </p>
<p>In addition, the names and contact details of three referees should be entered online here: <a href="https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/content/refereesubmissionformearthdatascience">EOAS referee submission form</a>. Referees will be sent an automated email requesting submission of letters before the deadline. Applicants should follow-up with referees to confirm receipt of the automated message and submission of letter before November 24, 2019.</p>
<p>Review of applications will start November 18, 2019. The successful applicant is expected to start in July 2020 or at a date of mutual agreement. This position is subject to final budgetary approval.</p>
<p>Equity and diversity are essential to academic excellence. An open and diverse community fosters the inclusion of voices that have been underrepresented or discouraged. We encourage applications from members of groups that have been marginalized on any grounds enumerated under the B.C. Human Rights Code, including sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, racialization, disability, political belief, religion, marital or family status, age, and/or status as a First Nation, Metis, Inuit, or Indigenous person.</p>
